# PlannedOut
This website aims to relieve the stress many students feel due to the lack of organization by creating a personalized schedule for students using AI. The program takes in assignments uploaded by teachers and scans them, taking into account the length of the assignment and the difficulty. After doing this, the program estimates the amount of time it will take to complete the assignment. Using this information, as well as information inputted by the students, such as clubs and other activities that they participate in, the program creates a schedule for the student made for maximum productivity, including breaks, reminders, and many other features to keep students on the track for success and getting all of their work done.
